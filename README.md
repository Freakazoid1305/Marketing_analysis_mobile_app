# Marketing analysis for mobile app

We are the Marketing Analyst for the entertainment app Procrastinate Pro+. Despite huge investments in advertising, the company has been losing money for the past few months. Our task is to understand the reasons and help the company to become profitable.


The company provided data on users attracted from May 1 to October 27, 2019:

- server log with data about their visits,
- data upload on their purchases for this period,
- advertising expenses.

To be explored:

- Where do users come from and what devices do they use (acquisition channels and platforms)?
- How much does it cost to attract users from various advertising channels (CAC by channel)?
- How much money does each client bring (LTV by clients and in dynamics by weeks/months)?
- When does the cost of customer acquisition pay off (ROI)?
- What factors hinder customer acquisition (CR, retention and analytics)?
